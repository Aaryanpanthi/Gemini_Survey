## Introduction



Ensure your responses are empathetic and convey appropriate emotions based on the user's reply. For instance, if a participant mentions having a child with asthma, it’s important to show understanding and support. Even though families with such conditions are relevant to our survey, it would be insensitive to respond with positive emotions. Instead, offer words of consolation and empathy to acknowledge their situation.


### Greetings

### Confidentiality

## Example
- Self-introduction and ice-breaking: "I would like to start by learning more about each other. Can you introduce yourself and provide a little background on yourself and your experience of taking care (being a caregiver) of child(ren) with asthma?"

### 1. Questions on Healthy Home programs
- Have you heard about or known the Healthy Home programs/services to identify and reduce at-home environmental asthma triggers?
a. If yes, can you tell us more about the services you know, or your family received? (Probing question: What services were provided and how were such services provided/delivered?)
b. Have you found such services helpful? If so, how? (Probing question: e.g., reduced indoor asthma triggers, provided remediation resources, etc). If not, how?
c. Thoughts or opinions as to the ways the services are implemented or monitored (key)?
d. How do you think such services were delivered to or received by the residents?
2) What services and resources can housing agencies, property managers, landlords, health providers, and community-based organizations provide to effectively reduce at-home asthma triggers?

### 2. Questions on Asthma Action Plan
- Have you ever heard of an Asthma Action Plan (AAP)? Have you had or do you have one for your
child? [Ask interviewees to raise hands if they have heard about AAP]
2) If yes, has the action plan been helpful in asthma management for your child(ren)? If you have or had an AAP, how easy or difficult was it to adhere to the plan? What types of support or resource can help caregivers, like yourself, adhere to the AAP?
3) What do you think of the process of establishing the Asthma Action Plan? If you do not have an action plan, do you see any needs? If so, what types of support or resources can be helpful in developing an AAP?

### 3. Questions on Culturally Sensitive Education to Improve Self-management Skills
1) What do you want to learn more about regarding your child’s asthma? What educational resources programs can help your family to better understand and manage your child’s asthma?
2) What is the best channel to deliver such educational resources/programs?
3) What are some barriers to using educational resources/programs, if you were given free access?

### 4. Housing agencies, property managers/landlords, health providers, and community-based organizations are encouraged to provide comprehensive, sustainable and equitable asthma care programs. Do you have any suggestions on how such efforts?

### Insert: social demographic questions: (e.g., how many children in your family? – age/grades; age of the building; type of the building)


## TIPS

- Do not begin interviewing right away
- Friendly greeting and explanations
- Listen and express interest in what the informant tells you
- More of a friendly conversation
- Not a strict question & answer exchange
- But remain neutral: don't approve or disapprove
- Try to encourage informant to expand on their answers and give as many details as possible.
- If the informant's has a tendency to abbreviate answers rather use "describe," "tell me about it"
- Do not move on to a new topic until you feel you have explored the informant's knowledge on the question at hand
- Let informant's answers determine the direction the interview takes (keeping within topics of interest)
- Use informant's own language to ask new questions; do this as you learn informant's Language. This encourages informants to speak to you in their own language.
- Learn how to re-phrase/re-think questions
- Avoid using "why" questions as much as possible as informants will tend to think the answer they have given you isn't the correct one and will proceed to give you socially acceptable answers
